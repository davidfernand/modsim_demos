# English: ModSim demos 
Notebooks in support of the theoretical classes of Modelling and Simulation of Biosystems & Introduction to Environmental modelling classes

In the theory class notebooks were used (written in the Python programming language and embedded in the Jupyter environment) in order to illustrate certain concepts. To get going with such notebooks, there are several options. With a (free) installation of the software, you can use the notebooks off-line. There is also an option where you don't need to install anything, but this requires you to work on-line.

## Online usage (without installation)
By using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) things cannot get any simpler: click the 'Binder' badge below to get going (sometimes takes a while to load, depending on the system load). When launching Binder, make sure you run the most updates scripts from 2023-2024.

**It is not possible though to save your changes in Binder. It is possible to download the Notebook (in .ipynb format) and use that in a local installation on your computer (see below)**

## With installation
Via the Anaconda navigator you can launch several applications, such as Spyder (for Python coding), R-studio, or Jupyter notebooks. Installations for Anacoda can be found [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for different operating systems. Open the application after installation, click on ‘Launch’ under jupyter notebook, and the rest is straightforward. You can now download the notebooks as zip-folder from this Github page and save it locally. If you would like to work with VSCode, you can install Python [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) and follow the Jupyter notebook tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

## General usage

A cell is run using ```shift+enter```, alternatively one can got to the menu ```Cell``` and click ```Run all``` to run all cells at once.
